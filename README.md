# Trac Theme based on Twitter Bootstrap

Works with:

* Trac 0.12.5
* Bootstrap 2.0.3

This code is under Public License.

This is a quick hack to add bootstrap theme to Trac.

This is far from being complete.

The provided makefile can create a Python virtialenv for trac, create a demo
trac project and start trac.

To create the testing/dev environment::

    make deps

To start Trac for testing:

    make run

Default username and password is: username/password.

## Bootstrap 3
This theme is currently being converted to use bootstrap 3.0 and be a full theme.
Checkout the `bootstrap-3.0` branch to view progress.
